Today I put the source for fusequota up on google code and began ensuring that
the code meets the GNU Coding Standards. I wrote a test to test mounting and
unmounting a quota-enabled filesystem and wrote the basic configuration for
autoconf and automake.

The current version should support the features it has set out to initially
support. Much documentation needs to happen but the code should at least be
in a testable state.
